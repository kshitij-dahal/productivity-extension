v1
- if button in pause state, change its and the timers colour to red
- if button in continue state, change its and the timers colour to green
- restart timer if it is a new day x
- reconsider timer formatting (eg. 11m23s)
- add hour in timer x
- if its new day, store last days value in storage x
- show the days that the goal was met on the calendar in newtab
- add pomodoro mode
- add calendar streak view
- add calendar time view
- bugs: set 1h goal and remaining time shows 59 min
- bug: setting goal right away when tab loads
- bug: IF GOAL IS SET AT SOME MIN AND SOME SEC THEN IT WONT FINISH AT THAT SEC BECAUSE BACKGROUND ONLY SENDS VALUE AT EVERY MINUTE SO FIX THAT
- make pomodoro mode work if it is on (aka not show notifs) x
- after goal is reached, change the flashing message
- after goal is finished, time remaining acts wierd if timer continues
- goal can only be set once per day so add new storage value: (stored value so far), think about timer running 
without goal being set
- calculate color value of remaining time

v2
- give user the option to view graph 
- - have 2 graph options: streaks view as calendar or graph view with exact time studied
- allow user to set daily goal
- show graph with whether or not daily goal was met
- allow user to set notification when a certain amount of time has passed (eg. 25 min similar to pomodoro)
- add icon (2 separate icons for timer running and timer paused)
